A Mycroft skill that reads events from your Google Calendar

## About
Currently you can use this skill to ask Mycroft to list what events you have on your Google Calendar today or tomorrow.

### Setup
You should have gone through the setup process for obtaining and authorizing your credentials for accessing your Google Calendar account. This should add the .credentials directory to your home directory and populate it with the files google_calendar_skill_secret.json and google_calendar_skill_token.json. If the skill is telling you that your credentials are invalid or the files do not exist, run the bash command 'get_credentials.py --noauth_local_webserver' inside this skill's directory.

## Examples
* "What is going on today?"
* "What do I have scheduled tonight?"
* "What is happening tomorrow?"
* "What is on my schedule for tomorrow?"
